# Changelog

pinkdb is developed in numbered waves: each wave ships one focused capability
(or a performance pass) with its own tests and CI gates. This file is the
user-facing summary — one section per wave, newest first — while the
[ROADMAP progress log](ROADMAP.md#progress-log) carries the full engineering
detail (probes, gate counts, integration notes). Entries are appended at
integration time starting with wave 63; earlier waves are backfilled as
one-liners below.

## 2026-10-17

### Wave 67 — lake maintenance ✅
- **Compaction**: `merge_adjacent_files` publishes one new version referencing
  consolidated files — groups of delete-free files sharing partition values and
  schema epoch (≥2 members) merge into one; source files are **never touched**
  (bytes and mtimes pinned by tests) and row counts/zone maps stay exact.
  `rewrite_data_files` materializes deletes above a threshold.
- **Retention**: `expire_snapshots` removes old snapshots + commit deltas
  (explicit versions, `older_than`, or `retain_last` — never the current
  version); `cleanup_old_files` / `delete_orphaned_files` delete only
  unreferenced `data/` objects, behind a 2-day age gate and an explicit
  dry-run/confirm; encrypted lakes included.
- **Introspection**: `.lake files / table_info / options / settings` (+
  `merge`, `rewrite`, `expire`, `cleanup`, `orphans`).

### Wave 57 — lake encryption at rest ✅
- With the `encryption` feature, a keyed session (`PINKDB_KEY`, consistent with
  the engine) seals **every lake object** — catalogs, snapshots, commit deltas,
  data files, delete files — as `PNKLAKE1` **AES-256-GCM** containers under one
  Argon2id derivation per session. A `Storage`-level decorator means commits,
  deletes, time travel and retry paths are covered with no per-call-site code.
- The `catalog.json == snapshots/<v>.json` byte invariant survives (seal once,
  publish the same ciphertext); **S3 conditional-write CAS is unchanged**;
  statistics-fast attach on encrypted lean lakes still decodes zero data files.
- Wrong/missing keys and tampered containers fail closed with authenticated
  errors (never “corrupt file”); plaintext lakes stay byte-identical and are
  refused by keyed sessions. Encrypted Vortex attach reads whole objects in
  stage 1 (segment-level reads documented as the follow-up).

### Wave 65 — lake schema evolution ✅
- `ALTER TABLE` on writable-attached lake tables — `ADD COLUMN … DEFAULT`,
  `RENAME COLUMN`, `DROP COLUMN` (plus the engine-wide `ALTER TABLE` support
  behind it: defaults, `NOT NULL` rules, `DESCRIBE` defaults, WAL replay) —
  published as **metadata-only** catalog schema versions (format now **v5**):
  old data files are never rewritten; they project through rename chains,
  missing columns materialize their defaults, and dropped columns keep their
  bytes (row positions unchanged — delete files stay valid).
- **Time travel reads each version with that version's schema and names**;
  writes across versions keep working through the projection.
- Limits (documented): `RENAME TABLE` through a lake commit is refused with a
  `.lake save` hint; no `ALTER COLUMN TYPE` / `SET|DROP DEFAULT` /
  `ADD CONSTRAINT`; read-only attachments refuse `ALTER`.

### Wave 66 — lake partitioning & pruning ✅
- Lake tables can be **partitioned**: identity values or `bucket(N)` labels are
  recorded per file, commits write **one data file per partition value set**,
  and spec changes (`.lake partition … by (…) | clear`) never rewrite old
  files.
- Every v4 data file publishes a CRC-protected **zone map** in the catalog
  (Vortex files newly); the planner prunes whole files for exact predicates —
  `WHERE region = 'x'` reads only that partition's file, and disjoint ranges
  read zero.
- `COUNT`/`MIN`/`MAX` honesty rules are preserved (fall back once positional
  deletes exist); pruning stays correct with deletes and across time travel.
- Limits (documented): bucket labels are pinkdb's own hash (no cross-engine
  numbers, no bucket-value pruning); `year/month/…` transforms are refused by
  name.

### Wave 73 — docs catch-up, changelog & site wiring
- Follow-up: a **SQL dialect reference** page — statements / queries / types
  tables plus the known-divergences list (correlated subqueries, USING/NATURAL
  joins, three-part references, CTE `AT` handling) — added under Reference.
- Website docs brought current through waves 58–64: **SQL** (prepared statements
  with the `prepare` → `bind` → `execute_bound` flow, DECIMAL/INTERVAL with the
  DuckDB promotion rules, declarative keys + FK→PK elimination, full/multi-way
  joins, the new function set, `EXPLAIN`/`SHOW`/`DESCRIBE`, set operations),
  **persistence** (`.pink` v5 with the constraint section and type tags; WAL v4
  touched sets; optimistic commits and `PINKDB_TXN_RETRIES`), **lake**
  (incremental commits with the 1M-row numbers and DuckLake retry knobs, writable
  attach, `AT (VERSION/TIMESTAMP)` time travel, per-version records, catalog
  `format_version` 4), **CLI** (new `.lake` commands, author/message, retry env
  vars), **server** (protocol v6, `Prepare`/`ExecutePrepared`/`Prepared` frames),
  plus landing/roadmap/API/guide updates.
- New **Changelog** docs page generated from this file
  (`website/tools/make-changelog.py`), linked from the sidebar, footer and
  roadmap page.
- CI's docs job now regenerates the changelog fragment + the site and **fails on a
  stale diff** — regenerate-and-commit is enforced; `website/README.md` documents
  the tooling.

### Wave 63 — incremental lake writes ✅
- Lake commits now **append**: each commit writes one new immutable data file
  per table (with its exact row count in the catalog) and never rewrites a
  published file — a 1M-row lake committed 4 rows in **7.6 KB / 0.54 s with 0
  bytes rewritten** (vs a 2.6 MB full save).
- **DELETE / UPDATE** write positional delete files applied at read time
  (merge-on-read); every published version also writes a small
  `commits/<v>.json` delta manifest.
- **Writable attached lakes**: `.lake attach <dir> write`, mutate with normal
  SQL, `.lake commit` publishes the diff; guarded `.lake detach`; durable
  sessions replay commits idempotently after a crash.
- **Concurrent-writer retry** with DuckLake's settings and defaults
  (`max_retry_count` 10, `retry_backoff` 1.5, `retry_wait_ms` 100 — rebase on
  conflict, bounded, clean failure).
- Fixes after landing: the feature-less build message and the S3 Docker
  expectations updated for the new catalog format (`format_version` 4).

### Wave 64 — lake time travel & snapshot metadata ✅
- Query any published lake version: `SELECT … FROM t AT (VERSION => n)` /
  `AT (TIMESTAMP => ts)` on attached lake tables, with DuckLake-pinned
  resolution (timestamp = newest snapshot at or before it, inclusive).
- **Per-version records**: `.lake snapshots` lists time, author, message,
  `(tables, rows)` and a change summary; `.lake save … author '…' message '…'`
  attaches commit metadata.
- Statistics fast paths work per version: `COUNT`/`MIN`/`MAX` over an older
  version decode no data files.
- `ducklake_default_version` deliberately not mirrored (probed: it selects a
  new-catalog storage format, not a read default).

### Wave 41 — primary / foreign keys ✅
- Declarative `PRIMARY KEY` / `UNIQUE` / `NOT NULL` / `REFERENCES` in column
  and table form (`CONSTRAINT` names; `RELY` / `[NOT] ENFORCED` accepted and
  dropped), validated at DDL time like DuckDB.
- Constraints are **metadata-only** — writes never enforce them; `DESCRIBE`
  reports `PRI`/`UNI` markers and nullability.
- Optimizer: conservative **FK→PK join elimination** (declarations are
  trusted, not verified — documented).

### Wave 62 — DECIMAL and INTERVAL types ✅
- Full DECIMAL(38) and INTERVAL support: literals, arithmetic with DuckDB's
  promotion rules, comparisons, sums, CSV import/export, date ± interval.
- `.pink` v5 (new type tags), server protocol v6, FFI text cells for both.

### Wave 59 — prepared statements ✅
- `?` placeholders with bind-time type inference; engine `prepare` → `bind` →
  `execute`; server protocol `Prepare`/`ExecutePrepared`; FFI
  prepare/bind/execute. (Python/Go wrappers: wave 69, queued.)

### Process notes (no user-visible change)
- DuckLake feature-gap audit (live probes) queued as waves 63–68; extension
  waves 70–72 queued (parquet, arrow, iceberg).
- Disk-full incident and recovery: the four-worktree batch was salvaged and
  landed wave by wave.
- Multiprocess test-harness determinism fix (macOS CI flake).
- Fresh-day benchmark record: query battery 234 ms; multi-writer 2.55×; lake
  25.1 MB vs DuckLake 91.4 MB at 10M rows.
