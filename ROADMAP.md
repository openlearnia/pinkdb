# pinkdb Roadmap

Single source of truth for wave status; update after every wave.

## Packaging principles

- New capabilities ship as separate workspace crates and/or opt-in cargo features; the default
  `cargo build` stays lean (~2 MB) and links no crypto/TLS/format code.
- Every wave reports per-artifact release binary size; CI gates grow a build matrix (default,
  each feature, each crate) plus a wasm check — `pinkdb` and `pinkdb-parquet` must stay
  wasm32-compatible, and the server is target-gated out of wasm builds.
- No hand-rolled crypto; audited RustCrypto crates only.
- Zero-`unsafe` holds for the core; contained `unsafe` is confined to `pinkdb-ffi` (wave 26)
  and `pinkdb-ext-loader` (wave 29). Compile-time engine components ship as separate
  crates/features (waves 22–28), distinct from waves 29+ loadable extensions (versioned C ABI
  + runtime loader).

Status: `done` / `in progress` / `queued`. A wave is `done` only when `cargo build` +
`cargo test` + `cargo clippy` are green (plus duckdiff/bench where applicable).

  follow-ups 709ede4 and 6dfb8c4.
- 2026-10-12 — Wave 22: WAL / crash recovery — WAL v2 generation scheme (sidecar `.pink.wal`,
  roll files `<wal>.<gen>.roll`, recovery publishes before deleting, crash-idempotent); durable
  `.import` checkpoints; `.save` path identity; view-dependent DML refused on durable DBs;
  crash tests + kill-loop harness `bench/kill_loop.py`. 253 lib + 3 CLI unit + 9 CLI
  integration tests, duckdiff 60/60, kill loop 100/100 random + 40/40 targeted clean,
  bench ≈498 ms.

  `db.table` in both parsers; per-connection session scoping; `.pink` v2 (v1 back-compat
  fixture); WAL session-prefixed records with the dropped-db replay hole fixed;
  `.databases`/scoped `.tables`/`.schema`/quoted `.import`; view-body CTE isolation;

  binary, explicit `BatchDone` terminator, typed values); thread-per-connection zero-async

  optional `client` feature; durable `--file` mode with WAL replay. 366 tests (incl.
  server/durable/remote) both parser modes, duckdiff 60/60, kill loop 30/30 clean, bench
  ≈488 ms; release sizes `pinkdb` 2.19 MB and `pinkdb-server` 1.84 MB.
- 2026-10-12 — Wave 25: at-rest encryption — `PINKENC1` container (AES-256-GCM + Argon2id,
  feature-gated, zero crypto in default builds); encrypted `.pink` + WAL preserving wave-22
  recovery invariants; fresh-nonce-prefix-per-open eliminates the boundary-truncation nonce
  reuse; checkpoint refuses mode/key changes on live stores; `PINKDB_KEY` env (non-UTF8 is a
  hard error); Argon2 work bounds; terminal checkpoint segment. 376 default / 412 with
  `--features encryption` tests (both parser modes); clippy clean all feature sets;
  duckdiff 60/60; kill loops 30/30 plain + 30/30 encrypted + 15/15 encrypted multi-db;
  boundary-truncation nonce-reuse fix proven by regression; sizes 2.21 MB default /
  2.28 MB encrypted / `pinkdb-server` 1.84 MB.
- 2026-10-12 — Binary size: `pinkdb` 2.21 MB (2.28 MB with `--features encryption`) +
  `pinkdb-server` 1.84 MB (release, after wave 25; pre-wave-17 was 2.26 MB).
